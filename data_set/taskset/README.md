# Tasks
This file contains the training tasks and experiment tasks present in `client_side/.infrastructure/tasks/. The tasks are adapted from the sampling script in this folder that were then validated from our pilot.

## Experiment Tasks
- Recursively delete all empty subdirectories under the current directory.
- Show the lines of `./content/review/review2.md` that are not in `./content/review/review1.md`
- Count the number of files in './content/labs/' and subdirectories recursively.
- Remove all files except 'tips.md' in directory './content/'.
- Recursively remove all files in the './css/' directory.
- List the names of the directories that are children of children of the './content/' directory.
- List recursively all the non-markdown files in the current directory.
- Delete recursively all markdown files starting with a number under the current directory.
- Show which files differ recursively between './content/labs/' and './content/lessons/'.
- Recursively list all files in the current directory that are larger than 10kB.
- Find all lines containing 'why' (case insensitive) in files with 'review' in their filename recursively contained in the current directory.
- Show the size of files and directories in 'content/' in the expected human-friendly format, ordered by size.

## Training Tasks
- Rename file './README.md' to './README.txt'
- Display the content of the CSS file in the './css/' directory.
- Delete recursively all files containing 'glyph' in their filename under the current directory.
