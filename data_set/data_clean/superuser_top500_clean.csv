1,https://superuser.com/questions/183870/,Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile,"[""Traditionally, when you log into a Unix system, the system would start one program for you. That program is a shell, i.e., a program designed to start other programs. It's a command line shell: you start another program by typing its name. The default shell, a Bourne shell, reads commands from ~/.profile when it is invoked as the login shell."", ""Bash is a Bourne-like shell. It reads commands from ~/.bash_profile when it is invoked as the login shell, and if that file doesn't exist¹, it tries reading ~/.profile instead."", ""You can invoke a shell directly at any time, for example by launching a terminal emulator inside a GUI environment. If the shell is not a login shell, it doesn't read ~/.profile. When you start bash as an interactive shell (i.e., not to run a script), it reads ~/.bashrc (except when invoked as a login shell, then it only reads ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile."", 'Therefore:', '~/.profile is the place to put stuff that applies to your whole session, such as programs that you want to start when you log in (but not graphical programs, they go into a different file), and environment variable definitions.', '~/.bashrc is the place to put stuff that applies only to bash itself, such as alias and function definitions, shell options, and prompt settings.

This is a logical place to include ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive. I recommend the following contents in ~/.bash_profile:"", ""On modern unices, there's an added complication related to ~/.profile. If you log in in a graphical environment (that is, if the program where you type your password is running in graphics mode), you don't automatically get a login shell that reads ~/.profile. Depending on the graphical login program, on the window manager or desktop environment you run afterwards, and on how your distribution configured these programs, your ~/.profile may or may not be read. If it's not, there's usually another place where you can define environment variables and programs to launch when you log in, but there is unfortunately no standard location."", 'Note that you may see here and there recommendations to either put environment variable definitions in ~/.bashrc or always launch login shells in terminals.

The most common problem with either of these ideas is that your environment variables will only be set in programs launched via the terminal, not in programs started directly with an icon or menu or keyboard shortcut.', ""¹  For completeness, by request: if .bash_profile doesn't exist, bash also tries .bash_login before falling back to .profile.

9,https://superuser.com/questions/421463/,Why does Ctrl + V not paste in Bash (Linux shell)?,"['In the days of physical terminals, session-wide clipboards did not exist, only few programs supported internal copy/paste – often under the name of ""buffers"" or ""kill rings"" – and used various different keystrokes. For example, the bash shell uses CtrlK or CtrlU to ""kill"" (cut), CtrlY to ""yank"" (paste); this comes from the emacs editor.', 'CtrlC almost everywhere in Unix was the ""interrupt"" key, used to cancel the current program or operation. The CtrlV key often meant ""verbatim insert"" – that is, insert the following character literally without performing any associated action. For example, a normal Esc switches to command mode in the vi editor, but CtrlV, Esc will insert the ESC character into the document.', 'The use of CtrlC to copy and CtrlV to paste from session-wide clipboard was introduced by Mac OS in 1983 and Microsoft Windows 3.x in 1990. (Earlier Windows versions (1.x and 2.x), as well as IBM OS/2, only supported the IBM CUA keys CtrlIns to copy and ShiftIns to paste; these shortcuts remain supported by all Windows versions.)', 'When GUIs with clipboard support finally reached Unix, the Ctrl keypresses were already in use by many terminal programs. In addition, the X graphical interface had somewhat different mechanisms: ""selections"" and ""cut buffers"". Even now you can select text in one program and insert it using the middle mouse button, without any explicit copy action.', 'In short, by the time Xterm and GNOME Terminal were written (I\'m guessing you use the latter), CtrlV already had a completely different meaning for many years and could not be changed. In addition, an alternative method of copying text – the ""selection"" – was already present in X11, so explicit copy/paste action was probably considered not as important as it would be in Windows. This means that different keyboard shortcuts had to be selected – for example, most modern terminal programs, like GNOME Terminal, use CtrlShiftC and CtrlShiftV. (If you use Xterm, the same shortcuts can be added manually using the XTerm*vt100*translations Xresource. Rxvt does not have such an option.)', '(Most X11 toolkits also support the CUA ""copy"" and ""paste"" keys, which do not conflict with terminal programs. Unfortunately, the implementations are rather inconsistent – CtrlIns copies to the ""clipboard"" in most programs (GTK, Qt4, but ignored by Xaw); however, ShiftIns pastes from the ""primary selection"" in most GTK and Qt4 programs, but from ""clipboard"" in Firefox, and from the now-obsolete cut-buffers in the now-obsolete Xaw.)', 'All that said, some terminals or consoles (in particular, the Windows 10 console) do support these keys. As the Windows console always had a separate ""mark/select"" mode, CtrlC now also has two meanings based on context – in regular mode it sends an interrupt, in select mode it copies to clipboard (just like Enter used to).', 'Meanwhile, Windows command-line tools never really used CtrlV for anything, so it was bound to ""paste"" without disturbing much anything. Doing the same on Unix-like terminals however would be more problematic.']",[<code>ESC</code>]

Steve Bourne was the first to show that the shell which controlled the user's interaction could be a user program and not a special part of the operating system.  A historic breakthrough.  The shell itself was relatively clean for scripting, but had no command-line editing or job control.  Bourne's Introduction to the Unix Shell is still useful for beginning users today."", 'Edit: I\'ve ignored some ""prehistory"" from Ken Thompson and John Mashey, also from Multics.  I\'m sure Bourne was aware of all this work (he was in the same lab, 1127, at Bell Labs), but Bourne\'s shell was definitive, and the earlier work had little influence except as interpreted by Steve Bourne.  For example, although Ken later wrote the Plan 9 C compiler and was very influential on Plan 9, but Tom Duff\'s paper on the Plan 9 shell (rc) mentions only Bourne\'s shell, not Thompson\'s.', 'The shell is just a user program, so anybody can write one.  As Version 7 Unix was being created in New Jersey, Berkeley Unix was being created in California.  Bill Joy at Berkeley wrote csh, the C shell.  Joy added job control and history, and later command-line editing, but was not aware of Bourne\'s work and so based his language on the Thompson shell (which I considered ""prehistoric"" in the previous bullet).  The Unix community loved job control, but they also loved Bourne\'s language.  For a not-particularly-good polemic against the csh language, see Csh Programming Considered Harmful.  For a time, many people used csh interactively for its job-control and history features, but used Bourne\'s sh to write scripts.  This situation was less than ideal.', 'Edit: Thanks to DigitalRoss for straightening me out on the chronology of csh.  Since I got my education from people who refer to BSD as ""the Berkeley heresy"", I was pretty short of facts there.', 'Dave Korn at Bell Labs did a brilliant re-engineering of the Bourne shell to produce the Korn shell (ksh).  It was fully backward compatible with Bourne shell sh but provided a boatload of invaluable improvements.  ksh became the basis of a POSIX standard and was shipped standard with Sun software.  (This despite the fact that Bill Joy left Berkeley to help found Sun and was one of their leading software guys.)', 'Bell Labs and AT&T stupidly fail to make ksh open source. ksh88 is widely used, but having sources is not legal.  Certain people become so addicted that they become digital criminals.', 'Edit: Was this really so stupid?   Hard to know. Berkeley was already giving Unix away, and other corporations were soon to follow, but this was still the era when the Corporate Masters believed in charging for Unix.
