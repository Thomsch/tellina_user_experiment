        Consent Information
    </h1>

    <p>We are asking you to be in a research study. This form gives you information to help you decide whether or not to
        be in the study. Being in the study is voluntary. Please read this carefully. You may ask any questions about
        the study. Then you can decide whether or not you want to be in the study.</p>

    <h4>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h4>
    <p>The purpose of the study is to evaluate how deep neural network-based recommender systems can help people achieve
        their daily tasks. For this study, we look at how a natural language-to-bash recommender can help programmers
        complete file system tasks in Bash.</p>

    <h4>STUDY PROCEDURES</h4>

    <p>
        The experiment starts with a short training session to get you familiarized with the recommender system and the
        task solving workflow.
        Then, you will be asked to complete two series of tasks where you have to write bash one-liners to complete file
        system tasks. The experiment concludes with a small survey through which we receive your feedback.
        The study will take approximately 1.5 hours of your time.
    </p>

    <h4>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h4>
    <p>
        You may experience discomfort characteristic of the regular usage of a computer system. Should you experience
        any discomfort, you may stop at any time.
    </p>

    <h4>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Short-term</b>. You will be financially compensated for your time. For participating in the entire study, you will be compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card. The gift card will be sent at most two weeks after your participation in the experiment.

        <br>

        <b>Long-term</b>. ​The findings from this research may benefit future software tools in various domains.
