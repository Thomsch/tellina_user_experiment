  <title>English to Bash Study</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>
    Welcome to the English to Bash study website!
  </h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for participating to this study! We are interested in evaluating if translation assistants can help
    programmers to write Bash scripts using English descriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    Before we start, please review carefully the <a href="consent.html">consent information</a> and sign
    at the bottom of the consent page. You <b>must</b> complete this step in order to continue.
  </p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    For the experiment to go as smoothly as possible, please ensure that you have access to a <a
      href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/software/linuxhomevm">CSE Linux Home VM</a> with <a
      href="https://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> installed. You can verify if Meld is installed by using the Meld command in
    your VM's terminal: <code>$ meld</code>. It should open a GUI window. To install Meld on your CSE Linux Home VM use
    <code>$ sudo yum install meld</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once all of those prerequisites are met and you are ready, please follow these step to start the experiment:
    <ol>
      <li>Download <a href="experiment.zip">experiment.zip</a> in a convenient folder on your CSE Linux Home VM.</li>
      <li>Unzip with <code>$ unzip experiment.zip</code></li>
      <li>Make sure to use a Bash environment <code>$ bash</code></li>
      <li>Start the experiment <code>$ source experiment/configure</code></li>
    </ol>
    When you start the experiment, follow the prompts in your terminal. You will have 2 training questions to familiarize yourself with the tool and then the real tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will be presented with a series of file system tasks that can be done within a Bash shell.
    For each task, you are encouraged to use a variety of tools (man pages, Google, etc.) to help you solve it. Your
    objective is to solve each task with a Bash one-liner: a bash script that is contained on one line. For example: 
    <code>$ ls | tee file</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Survey</h2>
  When you have finished the experiment, please complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/QieZPezcLSYoX2k26"
    target="_blank"> short survey</a> (5 minutes).

  <h2>End</h2>
  <p>You're all done! Thank you for your participation! We will be sending you the gift card soon at the address you provided in the survey.</p>
  
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to get in touch with us via the UW CSE Slack (@Thomas Schweizer) or by email (tschweiz AT cs.washington.edu).</p>
