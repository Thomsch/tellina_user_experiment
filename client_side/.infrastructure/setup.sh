### Experiment configuration

TASK_TIME_LIMIT=300

# Establish the server information
SERVER_HOST="https://homes.cs.washington.edu"
# Establish survey URL
EXPERIMENT_HOME_URL="${SERVER_HOST}/~tschweiz/research/en2bash-study"

POST_HANDLER="${EXPERIMENT_HOME_URL}/backend/post_handler/post_handler.php"

TELLINA_WEBSITE="https://tellina.rocks"

### Infrastructure

# The absolute path to the user experiment directory
EXP_DIR="$1"
# The absolute path to the experiment's infrastructure directory
INFRA_DIR="${EXP_DIR}/$(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE[0]})"

# Enables infrastructure functions.
source "${INFRA_DIR}"/infrastructure.sh

### Directories

TASKS_DIR="${INFRA_DIR}/tasks"

# The directory the user will perform tasks on
FS_DIR="${EXP_DIR}/file_system"

# The directory used by the infrastructure to reset FS_DIR.
FS_SYNC_DIR="${INFRA_DIR}/file_system"

# Contains output of user commands.
USER_OUT="${INFRA_DIR}/user_out"
mkdir -p "${USER_OUT}"

### Task-related variables

# The TASK_ORDER is two two-character codes.  In each two-character code, the
# letter T/N is for Tellina/NoTellina, and the number indicates the task_set
# used.
TASK_ORDERS_CODES=("T1N2" "T2N1" "N1T2" "N2T1")

# integer division creating difficulties for splitting up the task sets.

# experiment.

  # be one lower to allow the user to start at the task where they previously
  # stopped.

### User meta-commands

HLINE="--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

# Each user meta-command will create a file called .noverify in the
# infrastructure directory.

# giveup writes "giveup" to `.noverify`.
# This is because aliases can't set variables and giveup needs to set $status
# to "giveup". precmd_func checks the contents.

### Variables that differ per user
